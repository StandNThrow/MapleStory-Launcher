# MapleStory-Launcher
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6h3omllhr0anj10q/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/RuChernChong/maplestory-launcher/branch/master)

Used to play MapleStory and games takes a long time to load in fullscreen. Thus I created this to tweak the registry settings for each launch to Windowed mode to reduce launch timing. Also a side app to practice VB.NET
